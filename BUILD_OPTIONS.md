# Build Options for SeamlessExpressive Base Image

You have two options for building and publishing the base image:

## Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)

**Advantages:**
- Builds on GitHub's servers (free)
- No local resources needed
- Automatic builds on push
- Consistent build environment
- Integrated with GitHub Container Registry

**How to use:**
1. Copy the `.github` folder to your repository root:
   ```bash
   cp -r seamless-base-image/.github ../../../.github
   ```

2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for base image"
   git push
   ```

3. The build will start automatically, or trigger manually:
   - Go to your repo's Actions tab
   - Select "Build and Push Base Image"
   - Click "Run workflow"

**Build time:** ~20-30 minutes on GitHub's servers

## Option 2: Local Build (Currently Running)

**Advantages:**
- Immediate feedback
- Full control over build process
- Can test locally before pushing
- No need to set up GitHub Actions

**Disadvantages:**
- Uses your local CPU/bandwidth
- Takes 15-30 minutes locally
- Requires Docker installed locally

**How to use:**
```bash
cd seamless-base-image/
./docker-login.sh  # First time only
./build-and-push.sh
```

## Which Should You Use?

- **For production:** Use GitHub Actions - it's more reliable and doesn't tie up your machine
- **For testing:** Local build is fine for quick iterations
- **For CI/CD:** GitHub Actions integrates better with your deployment pipeline

## Canceling the Current Build

If you want to cancel the current local build and switch to GitHub Actions:
1. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the build
2. Set up GitHub Actions as described above
3. Let GitHub build it for you

## Cost Comparison

- **GitHub Actions:** FREE for public repos, 2000 minutes/month for private
- **Local Build:** Uses your electricity and bandwidth

The GitHub Actions approach is what most production projects use, including the StyleTTS base image pattern you mentioned.
